I'm leveraging AI to generate web-based Spotify front-ends that recreate a vintage-jukebox-style experience.
<br>
While these pages will work fine on your desktop and other devices, they are primarily aimed at those wanting to simulate a traditional jukebox, whether retrofitting into a vintage machine or building one from scratch.
<br>
Personally, I like using ~24" touchscreen AIO PCs that can be found used for well under $100. But you could also navigate and use these pages with a minimal keypad, although a mouse or full keyboard might make it easier to load playlists or select devices initially. 

My first attempt was FruitySpot and you can find the readme / instructions for it @ https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/FruitySpot. The setup and prereqs for other creations should be similar.

Here's what AI has created so far, see each project's README for more details.

- FruitySpot -> The inital attempt at trying to recreate a Fruitbox skin, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/FruitySpot
- Nickel Player Hori -> AI chose the design from scratch, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/NickelPlayer-1920x1080
- Nickel Player Vert -> Same as above but optimized for portrait/vertical screens, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/NickelPlayer-1200x1600
- JLRipoff Connect version -> A CD/album style jukebox front end, heavily influenced by JukeLab, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/JLRipoff-connect
- JLRipoff WebSDK version -> A CD/album style jukebox front end, heavily influenced by JukeLab, runs standalone in browser: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/JLRipoff-websdk
