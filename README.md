I'm leveraging AI to generate web-based Spotify front-ends that recreate a vintage-jukebox-style experience.

My first attempt was FruitySpot and you can find the readme / instructions for it @ https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/FruitySpot. The setup and prereqs for other creations should be similar.

Here's what AI has created so far, see each project's README for more details.

- FruitySpot -> The inital attempt at trying to recreate a Fruitbox skin, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/FruitySpot
- Nickel Player Hori -> AI chose the design from scratch, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/NickelPlayer-1920x1080
- Nickel Player Vert -> Same as above but optimized for portrait/vertical screens, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/NickelPlayer-1200x1600
- JLRipoff Connect version -> A CD/album style jukebox front end, heavily influenced by JukeLab, needs a local Spotify device to work: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/JLRipoff-connect
- JLRipoff WebSDK version -> A CD/album style jukebox front end, heavily influenced by JukeLab, runs standalone in browser: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/JLRipoff-websdk
