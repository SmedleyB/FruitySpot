I'm leveraging AI to generate web-based Spotify front-ends that recreate a vintage-jukebox-style experience.

My first attempt was FruitySpot and you can find the readme / instructions for it @ https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/FruitySpot. The setup and prereqs for other creations should be similar.

Here's what AI has created so far, see their README for more details.

FruitySpot -> The inital attempt at trying to recreate a Fruitbox skin: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/FruitySpot
Nickel Player Hori -> AI chose the design from scratch: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/NickelPlayer-1920x1080
Nickel Player Vert -> Same as above but optimized for portrait/vertical screens: https://github.com/SmedleyB/FruitySpot/tree/main/NickelPlayer-1200x1600
